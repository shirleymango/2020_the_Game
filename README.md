# 2020_the_Game
A quiz game that tests your knowledge of the 2020 events timeline. 

Given the name and date of Event 1 and only the name of Event 2, you must guess whether Event 2 happened BEFORE or AFTER Event 1. You have 3 lives and for each incorrect answer, you will lose a life. The faster you answer, the more points you will earn. The events are chosen randomly so every game is going to look different.
